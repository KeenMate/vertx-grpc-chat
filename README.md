# vertx-grpc-chat
Classic chat in VertX with use of grpc


This is just a simple demo for us to see how easy or difficult is to implement a classical chat application with VertX and grpc. Both technologies are very promising but we'll see.

## Technologies involved
- VertX
- grpc
- VueJS
- Semantic
- Envoy (needed proxy server to translate http1 to http2 request)
  - This proxy might be replaced by Caddy if we will manage to get it working...
- Docker
